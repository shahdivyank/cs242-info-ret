In terms of research, the SATRD conducts basic, clinical and translational research. Its current efforts across several medical disciplines, which employ a range of research methods and treatment modalities, emerged from its historical roots as the first academic program in the United States to exclusively focus on co-morbid anxiety and sleep disturbances.\nThe early motivation for developing a subspecialty program dedicated to sleep and anxiety was the high rate of their comorbidity. The SATRD remains true to its original focus on the investigation and treatment of anxiety (social anxiety, obsessive compulsive, panic, generalized anxiety, post-traumatic & stressor, social anxiety) and sleep-wake disorders [insomnia, hypersomnolence, parasomnia (sleep paralysis, sleep panic attacks, sleep-related hallucinations), narcolepsy, nightmare disorders, circadian rhythm disturbances, REM behavioral disorders and RLS].\nBased on our early experiences in working with patients suffering from anxiety (stress)-sleep co-morbidities, the SATRD markedly expanded its attention to include anxiety, stress, mood, feeding-eating and sleep disturbances in a wider-spectrum of medical (e.g., cancer), neurological (e.g. tinnitus, empty nose syndrome) and mental-behavioral or substance use disorders as well as sensory processing conditions (hyposmia, parosmia, anosmia, pain, idiopathic environmental intolerance, chemical hypersensitivity). The SATRD works closely with the department's Clinical Trials and Innovation Sciences and Bipolar Research and Treatment Programs.\nThe SATRD houses the department's Psychophysiology and Sleep Research Unit (PSRU). The PSRU offers comprehensive psychophysiology resources, including state-of-the-art BrainVision EEG and Biopac physiology systems, to faculty members investigating dynamic neural, autonomic, and reflex markers of psychological or clinical processes. For the successful candidate in this position various brain stimulation resources (transcranial magnetic, focused ultrasound, and vagal nerve stimulation technologies) are available in collaboration with the departments' Brain Stimulation and/or Neuro-X Laboratories.\nPRSU recently expanded its sleep research beds to include psychophysiology testing rooms, 6-sleep research beds, which accommodates both children and adults, and serves as the main sleep research resource for MUSC's Sleep Center. Traditional sleep parameters are conducted but not limited to polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency (MSLT) & maintenance of wakefulness (MWT) tests. The sleep beds are accredited by The American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\nSATRD faculty members include psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, sleep medicine physicians, neuroscientists, physicist, big data scientist, pharmacologist, bench-laboratory scientists and neurologists among other backgrounds.\nThe successful candidate must be a physician with either an established track record of funded research or the career goal for achieving independent funding as a Clinician Scientist. Pre-existing experience in neurostimulation methods (TMS, TNS, VNS, FUS) or wish to develop expertise in these or other neurostimulation modalities as research tools or treatments is strongly preferred.\nThe faculty member in this position provides will serve as a medical leader within the SATRD and provide supervision to residents, psychology interns, fellows, and medical students. The successful candidate may apply for faculty status in the College of Medicine's Graduate School.\nThe faculty member will report to the Director of the Sleep and Anxiety Treatment and Research Division and is expected to engage in collaborative research across divisions, departments, and colleges within and outside of the Medical University of South Carolina.\nContact:\nThomas W.
