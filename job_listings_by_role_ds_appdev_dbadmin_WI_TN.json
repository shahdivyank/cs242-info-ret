Three decades later, Ramsey Solutions is a household name in personal finance, with a mission to change the toxic money culture for good.\n Our Mission: Ramsey Solutions provides biblically based, commonsense education and empowerment that give HOPE to everyone in every walk of life.\n Here’s a Taste of Our Benefits:\nHealth insurance (includes plans eligible for an HSA—with a company match up to $500!)\n401(k) retirement plan with 4% match/company contribution\nAnnual wellness, counseling and grocery membership reimbursement\nOn-campus cafe with subsidized pricing for breakfast, lunch and coffee bar\nDependent care FSA\nTons of cultural activities, like weekly devotional, leadership development courses, Battle of the Bands, and one epic Christmas party!\n Where and How You’d Work:\nRamsey Solutions Headquarters is located just outside of Nashville in Franklin, Tennessee. We value our strong, unified company culture because we believe the best work is done together. That’s why all of our team members work on-site under the same roof. But work-life balance is also important to us, so we offer flexible work schedules to take the stress out of appointments, family obligations and other needs that may pop up.\nWhile every team member has a designated workspace (with an electronic sit-stand desk), our campus was designed to house a variety of unique work and play zones (e.g., quiet library space, coffee bar/lounge areas, recreational game zone, and outside/patio work and break areas).\n What You’d Do in This Role:\nIn this role you’ll be producing business value through the creation of our Enterprise Data Warehouse and data platform ecosystems and related engineering capabilities and services, the goal of which is to enable optimal business insight generation.  You’ll be collaborating with our business leaders, stakeholders, and technology teams across the company to deliver cutting-edge, cloud-based solutions that enable a performant and stable data platform ecosystem.\n\nYou’re Probably a Match If:\nYou have 6+ years of experience with Python, Java, or another object-oriented programing language.\nYou are proficient with software engineering best practices such as CI/CD, Infrastructure as code, containerization (e.g., Docker, GoCD, CloudFormation).\nYou have experience with database technologies such as Redshift, Postgres, and MySQL RDBMS’s, and languages like SQL and procedural SQL.\nYou have experience with cloud technologies (preferably AWS) and services such as Step Functions, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS/SES, SQS, IAM, AWS Glue, CDK, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Firehouse, CloudWatch, Sagemaker.\nYou have the ability to clearly communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n What Winning Looks Like:\nPartnering with product management to identify Ramsey-wide analytic and business data problems and architecting solutions to solve them\nAssessing, scoping and prioritizing capability development while providing support for the Ramsey EDW, data platform, and related ecosystems\nWorking with cloud platform components, services, and service providers to achieve maximum uptime and performance with optimal cost\nPartnering with and educating partners across Ramsey on EDW and platform best practices, including such things as performance tuning and optimal 3rd party tool integration\nContinually building your engineering craft and awareness of industry trends and technologies around enterprise data platforms and warehousing\n Other Stuff to Know:\nWe’re looking for people who are passionate about our mission. This isn’t just a J-O-B. We experience resistance every day because what we believe is absolutely countercultural. We actually hate debt. We actually cut up our credit cards . . . like, for real. Some of us are still fighting our way out of debt, but we aren’t going back. If you don’t know much about Ramsey Solutions and our founder, Dave Ramsey, we encourage you to download the Ramsey Network mobile app and consume our content.\n If Ramsey Solutions sounds like a workplace where you can get excited about Mondays, apply today. We can’t wait to hear from you!\n EOE, including disability/vets\n ",

The company has developed a disruptive “IP Led Transformations” vision, strategy, and business model over the past 3 years. Some of the company’s IP was recently acquired by AWS and its overall business model has taken off sharply in 2024.\nTrianz is led by Sri Manchala, a former special forces officer from the Indian army and author of Crossing the Digital Faultline | Trianz, and a team of veterans from well-known firms such as Deloitte, HCL, KPMG, Wipro, Microsoft, TATA, AWS, GE, etc. \nAbout Trianz\nTrianz believes that companies around the world face three challenges in their digital transformation journeys - shrinking ‘time to transform’ due to competition & AI, lack of digital-ready talent, and uncertain economic conditions. To help clients leapfrog over these challenges, Trianz has built IP and platforms that have transformed the adoption of the cloud, data, analytics & insights AI.\nSpecifically, the following Trianz platforms are changing the way companies approach transformations in various disciplines:\nConcierto: A fully automated platform to Migrate, Manage, and Maximize the multi & hybrid cloud. A zero code and SaaS platform, Concierto allows teams to migrate to AWS, Azure and GCP and manage them efficiently from a single pane of glass. Visit www.concierto.cloud for more information.\nAvrio: is a Data to AI SaaS platform designed to drive data-led transformation at lightning speed. Through conversational AI, organizations seamlessly engage with all their data, unlocking real-time insights, and uncovering hidden opportunities and risks—all within one powerful platform. Visit www.avriodata.ai to know more.\nPulse: Recognizing that workforces will be distributed, mobile, and fluid, Trianz has built a ‘future of work’ digital workplace platform called Pulse. Visit www.trianz.com/Pulse\nSince the market launch of this strategy in mid-2023, Trianz has experienced enormous growth, success and recognition.\nSome of Trianz’ built IP in data and analytics was acquired by Amazon. Since then, Trianz has been made an engineering partner of Amazon for building/supporting connected ecosystems across multiple AWS platforms.\nMost recently, Trianz and AWS have signed a strategic collaboration agreement within which the two companies will work on joint roadmaps/solutions for the cloud; AWS will buy Trianz | Concierto in bulk for AWS partners to use for migrations; AWS will also recommend Concierto to their MSPs and finally, AWS Professional Services and Trianz have signed an agreement for joint solutioning and customer delivery. Read more: Trianz enters into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement with AWS to Revolutionize Cloud Adoption and Management (yahoo.com)\n Given all this, Trianz is experiencing a significant demand for its SW platforms and consequent growth. To support this growth, Trianz has recently raised private equity capital to scale the company over the next several years (Trianz Announces Strategic Growth Capital Investment by Capital Square Partners (prnewswire.com). It is now bolstering its senior and mid-level leadership with top talent across GTM, Engineering, Services, and Partnership organizations.

Our team is driven by an unyielding commitment to innovation, integrity, and collaboration, tackling some of the most significant challenges in science, security, and sustainability. If you're passionate about making a real impact and want to be part of a community that values diversity, and ethical excellence, this is the place where your ambition can thrive.\nHere, we believe that success comes from continuously pushing boundaries and working together to deliver on our promises. We embrace challenges with confidence and are dedicated to creating a secure and vibrant future for all. If you're ready to join a team that values your unique perspective and is committed to your safety, well-being, and professional growth.\nAbout the Opportunity \nThe ITER Risk and Opportunity Management (R&OM) strategy is expected to deliver a systematic, balanced, and cost effective approach to anticipate, identify, prioritize, manage and monitor risks and opportunities (R&Os) impacting the Project. This strategy is detailed in a dedicated and comprehensive R&OM procedure, which is a binding document within the framework of MQP, substantiated by dedicated work instructions for the IO and the DAs.\nYou'll provide expertise and support to the TROs, ROs, PCMs as well as more Senior Management to manage the review of existing Opportunities, ensure new ones are identified and assessed according to the defined criteria. The Baseline for the ITER Project does not include any schedule or cost contingencies. Therefore, the Opportunity Management Service must encourage the TROs/ROs as well as the more senior management to proactively identify opportunities.\nA strong emphasis is made to seek for, develop and implement Schedule Opportunities (to contribute maintaining First Plasma schedule and the overall project baseline) and Cost Saving Opportunities (to contribute maintaining the Overall Project Cost). Opportunity identification and realisation is the way IO creates additional schedule float and savings reserve to address the need of contingencies. \nWhere investments are needed to enhance opportunities, cost benefit analysis documents will be prepared with OMS input and expertise. \nThere is a dedicated database in use for both risks and opportunities, that connects with the P6 scheduling system and other IO systems for core data structures. \nYou'll perform the monthly review cycle for Level 1 and Level 2 Opportunities, and quarterly review cycle for other Opportunities. These reviews have to be performed with the relevant stakeholders and the outcome of the reviews captured into the PROR, using the fields and comment sections. Each review can be the focus of one Opportunity only, or several ones depending on the needs.\nAdditionally you will prepare the monthly Cost Savings Project Team (CSPT) meetings, in support to the head of the PCO who is the secretary of the meeting, the chair being the Corporate Domain Head. The Cost Savings Opportunities are the focus of these meetings. Key responsibilities: \nPerform monthly review and update of draft and open Opportunities\nProduce Cost benefit analysis for major Opportunities\nLead Opportunity identification sessions\nProduce monthly Opportunity Dashboards\nAdministrator of the PROMC-WG (for Schedule Opportunities) and of the CSPT (for Cost Savings Opportunities) meetings\nMonthly review and update of opportunities\nMonthly Opportunities Dashboards/Reports\nAdministrator of the CSPT, PROMC-WG and LII CCB (for opportunities)\nCost benefit analysis for major Opportunities\nOpportunity identification\nExperienced in Risk and Opportunity Management in major project for the relevant specific tasks\nAble to demonstrate the elements of risk and opportunity management\nFacilitating reviews and workshops and the development and implementation of mitigation/enhancement actions.\nExperienced in Risk and Opportunity Management for large project with complex governance.\nCertification in R&OM by a recognised international professional association is desirable, such as by APM/IRM.\nThe project language is English\nOur Culture\nOur values stand on a foundation of safety, integrity, inclusion and diversity. We put people at the heart of our business, and we genuinely believe that we all succeed by supporting one another through our culture of caring. We value positive mental health and a sense of belonging for all employees.  \nWe aim to embed inclusion and diversity in everything we do. We know that if we are inclusive, we’re more connected, and if we are diverse, we’re more creative. We accept people for who they are, regardless of age, disability, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, mental health, race, faith or belief, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, and whether you’re pregnant or on family leave. This is reflected in our wide range of Global Employee Networks centered on inclusion and diversity.\nWe partner with VERCIDA to help us attract and retain diverse talent.
